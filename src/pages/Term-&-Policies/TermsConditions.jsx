                <h2>RETURN</h2>
                <p>
                  We do not accept any returns on fulfilled orders due to the
                  nature of the products we produce.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If changes need to be made to ensure quality standards such as
                  editing and proofreading services are adhered to, alongside
                  requirements being followed, we have a revision process in
                  place that is there to help all customers as their
                  satisfaction is the most important thing to us. If the
                  fulfilled product does not meet the requirements, as specified
                  at the placement of the order, we will begin an extensive
                  internal review and either revise or recreate the content at
                  no additional cost.

                <h2>REVISIONS</h2>
                <p>
                  Each package has its own revision policy, per the service
                  description of each individual package. We provide revisions
                  within 5 to 10 days of the order going into the Waiting for
                  Customer Approval status in our Order Management Platform. The
                  revision period will depend on the ordered package.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Revisions come into play at the end of the order process, once
                  the product has been presented for review and the status has
                  updated to Waiting for Customer Approval. At this time, the
                  customer may request revisions directly by sending their
                  assigned Project Manager an email to ensure that the original
                  provided requirements have been met on the entire product. The
                  customer is always welcome to make changes personally to any
                  content they receive from us after the order has been
                  fulfilled and before publishing as it is delivered in a Word
                  format and they own the rights to it.

                <h2>REFUND POLICY</h2>
                <p>
                  We handle refunds on a case-by-case basis and do our best to
                  stand behind the customer and take care of their needs. Our
                  team will always work with the customer to resolve any issues
                  to the best of our ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Circumstances in which a refund may be provided include, but
                  are not limited to, should there be exceptional reason, orders
                  which have not yet been allocated and/or started at the time
                  of the refund request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Refunds, if processed, take between 5 to 15 days to reflect on
                  the customerâ€™s end. A processing fee of USD 250 or 5% of the
                  order amount (whichever is higher) will be charged in all
                  cases. The confirmation of approval for the refund request
                  will be provided by the support team and can only be made
                  through the original payment method used at the placement of
                  the order. You will also receive a notification of refund via
                  the email used at the original time of checkout.
                </p>
                <p>

                  is availed by the Client, we may provide a partial refund (up

                    We are committed to provide our customers with 100%

                    the delivery is up to the mark. We assign, re-assign and
                    re-write your work to ensure complete satisfaction. Reserve
                    FREE Pages for future, but of same value and you can avail
                    them at any time. If we're still not able to deliver what
